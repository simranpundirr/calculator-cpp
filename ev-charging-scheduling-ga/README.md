# EV Charging Scheduling using Genetic Algorithm

## Description
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the scheduling
of electric vehicle (EV) charging at a station.

## Objectives
- Minimize total waiting time
- Prioritize urgent EVs (low battery)
- Efficient utilization of charging ports

## Approach
- Charging schedules represented as chromosomes
- Fitness function based on waiting time and urgency
- Tournament selection, order crossover, and mutation applied
- Best schedule evolved over generations

## Technologies Used
- C++
